There are three things that you need to consider once you have identified that a question can be sovled using DFS
​
The base case ( return condition )
Mark that node as visited
Given that I am at a particular node what operations do I need to perform
The below solution explains how the above methodology can be used to sovle any DFS solution
​
The base case :
The current node cannot
a ) Exit the matrix bounding condition
b ) DIfferent from the base color
c ) Be a node that we have already visited
